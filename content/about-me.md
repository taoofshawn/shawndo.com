I read alot.  Possibly too much.  I actually read about what you should have on your &#8220;About Me&#8221; page.  I like the idea of being a little off or different, so I won&#8217;t talk about where I grew up or where I went to school.  I&#8217;ve recently become enamored with the idea of &#8220;living for now&#8221; and all that, so I&#8217;ll just tell you of myself now..

I live in NYC.  I realize more and more each day that it is the best place in the world!  I am a TSM administrator for a very large bank.  One that is still running and I&#8217;m fairly confident I will remain employed for the forseeable future.  I actually like my job, which seems rare in the financial IT world.

I&#8217;m an A.D.D. hobbyist.  I get very interested in some random topic (watch collecting, wine, poker, etc) and obsessively read and learn all I can.  I may dabble a little.  Perhaps buy 1 or 2 watches.  Maybe a few trips to Vegas  Eventually my interest wanes and I move on.  Sometimes my interests reignite, sometimes not.  I don&#8217;t really try to control it, I just let it ride. My current thing is photography.  This could get expensive&#8230;.
