I have been runnnig into a number of awesome documentaries on the History and Discovery channels lately. For some reason, I have been recording them and archiving them in mpeg form. I think to myself, that I will probably not watch them again, so why do I do that? I also have a tendency to do that with a number of other shows that I probably will watch only once. I'm a digital packrat. In real life I throw things away, if I don't think I'll use them again (or even for a long time). So why am I a digital packrat?  
  
Going to Brownsville tomorrow for a couple weeks. Hopefully the weather will be nice, and I can hang out at the beach. Gonna take some pictures with my snazzy camera.
