I took the first step to getting my teeth straightened up. I had to choose between: "orthognathic surgery" which basically means to break my jaw and bring it out to get rid of my overbite and make room for all my teeth OR pull one tooth to make room, and keep the overbite. I chose to just pull the tooth. I had that done this week, and it wasn't as painful as I thought it would be. Just a little inconvenient cause I had to avoid eating basically everything the first day, because it hurt too much. I healed pretty fast though, so it wasn't too much of an issue. On top of that I had a bad cold for over a week now. It went away, and I didn't have a fever, so I'm sure it wasn't SARS :)
