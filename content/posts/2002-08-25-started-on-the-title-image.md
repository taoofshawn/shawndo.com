Finally got around to working on the title image. Trying to figure out image tables (html) at the same time. I just can't seem to figure out the right side of the image! I want to get it so the obvious right side of the picture is always on the right side of the browser., even if you resize it. It seems to act _almost_ correct. I've been reading all the table references I can find, but can't seem to figure it out. Please contact me if you know what's up. Its a standard 100% width table. and the last cel doesn't go all the way to the right (as you can see) and the background image continues past it.
