Just got back from Providence and a Russian Submarine they have acting as a museum. Click [here][1] for images from their official site. Unfortunately I forgot my camera, so I do not have pictures yet. However, my buddy did bring his old film-type camera, so I'll eventually get some personalized sub photos up! It's the same sub that was used in the filming of K-19, so now I have to watch that one again.
