I had another really great restaurant experience at [Brasserie Jo][1]. I had the braised lamb shank. They served it with roasted vegetables and some kind of German pasta/dough (I can't rememer what the waiter called it) that soaked up the lamb gravy, and just tasted sublime. This was my second french restaurant experience (in my memory) and I have to say, they are 2 for 2. Them Gauls know a few things about food! It's a shame the media doesn't like them.
