Got seasons 1 and 2 of the Family Guy. I have to say, I like that show alot more than the Simpsons. It just seems the humor is more targeted at me than the Simpsons. Weird, huh? Also got a few more Poker books. Study study study!  

I only went to Foxwoods once this week. I should have gone on Thursday night, cause I didn't maintain my schedule. I woke up at 9am today, and I have to stay up until 7AM tomorrow. Might have to resort to coffee. I try and keep my coffee intake to a bare minimum, so when I need it, it really hits me. I think the last time I had coffee was over 2 months ago. Alright, gonna stop rambling...back to work.
