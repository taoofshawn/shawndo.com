Ace graduated towards the end of May, and we celebrated by taking him to Bouley.  We went to [Bouley][1], got the tasting menu and had the matching wines.  It's one of my favorite things in the world!  Note to self, "don't drink 2 Guinness before a multi-course meal!"  Grace couldn't make it, so KC filled in.  Great time, food, wine.  A friend introduced me to the term "smarmy", which is my latest source of amusement.  I think I have a few expressions which epitomize the feeling.  What do you think?  This is me in Bouley with one of the "smarmy" expressions.  I think I will pose smarmy for a while....  

My [Mr Ned][2] suit is complete. (Wore it to Bouley)  I need to take a few more pictures of it to get a critique in the clothing forums, but I like it.  The only thing is that the armholes aren't as high/tight as I would have liked it, so it feels a little restrictive if I actually move around in the thing.  Other than that, it was a good first custom suit experience, and I will come back to get it "just right".  Great value too, since it's about the same you would pay for a decent "beginner's" suit at BrooksBrothers.  I got a very light 8oz wool, so hopefully I can wear this through the summer.  

It has been a while since I updated this site, and I think it's because I've been planning a few changes.  I've been wanting to update wordpress, but my photo gallery plugin wouldn't have worked.  I'm not really a fan of managing my own gallery anymore, so I'm migrating to [Smugmug][3]. If you click on the [photos][4] link, you'll see that smugmug lets you customize it pretty heavily.  I customized it enough to make it seem like its the same site as everything else.  The CSS isn't perfect, and I'll be working on it.  I also got the random picture on the front look to smugmug. The next thing is to upgrade WordPress, which I'm looking to do this weekend maybe.
