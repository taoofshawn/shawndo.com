I actually cooked some fish today. Never done it before, and I feel so grown up now. I made that Dijon Salmon I mentioned in an earlier entry. It was OK, but nothing to write home about. Fish just doesn't "do" it for me. I don't disklike it or anything, but its just there. I just have to try some other methods or preparation I guess.  

I also wen't to the furniture store to buy a dinette. I finally found one with comfortable chairs. Should be here on thursday, at which point I will be stylin! Then I guess I'll need to get placemats and crap like that.
