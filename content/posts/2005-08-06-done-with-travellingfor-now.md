Finished Canada. I didn't realize how "Southern" it is! Lots of farms, country food, country music, and country folk. Met my cousins again after several years. It was interesting to realize that pretty much everyone with my last name was there, and involved less than 10 people. Never really thought about that before. My father only has one brother with 2 sons. He has no male cousins that have kids, so We're it!  

I've taken alot of vacation, but I still have a number of hours left. I'm going to wait a bit before I ask for more.  

Back to the grind of laying around all week. Tough life.
