Got back from Montreal. It was OK. Nothing insanely great, but it was worth the trip. Maybe I'll visit one more time. But I have to say I still prefer Mexico so far. I'll have to give it another shot. Beautiful french speaking women though. Too bad I can't speak french. Oh well. Forgot my camera, so I didn't get any pictures anywhere. One thing about Canada though. As soon as we crossed the border, the land was all flat farm land. Not unlike Texas. However, it was all covered in snow. There is something very evil about that.  

Tuesday Gary and I are hittin Foxwoods. This one is the largest and most profitable casino in the US. Hopefully their record won't hold on Tuesday!
