So I may have mentioned before, that my new apartment has a monopoly deal with Verizon DSL for internet access and DirectTV for TV. So...Its a new building and I set up for an account 3 weeks ago. Apparently they hadn't hooked up the building, and they were supposed to do that 2 weeks ago. Well they finally hooked up 2 out of the 3 buildings yesterday (Yes I am in the 3rd building) Once that happens, they can call me to schedule a time to come out, which will probably take another week. So.. Im comin into work everyday for my fix. Sucks to be me!  
  
AND! My sister took off to Belize, and the UPS folks are trying to deliver the computer I bought for her.
