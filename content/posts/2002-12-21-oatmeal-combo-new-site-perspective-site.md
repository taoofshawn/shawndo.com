After trying a bunch of additions to oatmeal to make it bearable, I finally found something. And it fits the shawn-style. I kept on trynig different fruits, bananas, strawberries, etc. But for some reason, it didn't do it for me. And, if you know me, I don't like going to the grocery store too much, so I like to buy alot of crap to minimize the visits. This however has a negative effect on "fresh" foods. So I pretty much have to get storable foods. So I found these little cans of fruit cocktail. This is very Shawndo. I mixed one of these with a bowl of oatmeal, and it is finally edible. Damn cholesterol.  
  
Working on a new site for my dad. [The-Drews.com][1] Basically a Drew family site. Still working on it, so its not presentable just yet.  
  
I'm thinking about the layout for another site as well. I bought "setilab.org" a while ago, and now I have pictures of all the computers involved in running seti. Just trying to decide what other content will be on there.
