I'm not going to talk too much about New Year's.  Remembering too much might not make me feel all that well..... brrrrp!  As you can see, I had a good time.  Hung around the ol' neighborhood.  A number of bars in the Village actually close on New Year's.  I guess everyone goes to Midtown.  Marisa's cousin Nicole visited with a couple friends and we all had a great time.  It did take me a day or so to recover, but totally worth it!  I tried to take photos without flash, but I was expecting a bit much from my [LX3][4].  It seems that softening a hard flash is much easier than illuminating underexposure in "post-processing"  Even when using RAW files.  So I guess it's flash until I get around to buying a [D700][1].  If I ever get one.  
The commercials have inspired me to finally reading the [Watchmen][2].  It's always been on my "to do" list, but just kept being pushed back.  I read a little about the background, which led me to read a little about [Alan Moore][3].  I love how he pretty much hates everyone that wants to do anything with his work.  And reading down the list of his work, that's a lot of people!  I got this awesome large-format hardcover edition of the graphic novel called "The Absolute Watchmen" and am working through this now.
