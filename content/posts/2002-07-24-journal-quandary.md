So I found a version of the journal that sbrooks wrote (from dogdoo.net) that portalzine.de modified to work with .714. Exactly what I need!, BUT.... so portalzine.de gets this journal from sbrooks. Modifies it, then puts it on their list of downloads only available to paid subscribers. I thought this was a total violation of the GNU GPL, but after reading [this][1], it seems that this is acceptable. So.. the question is, is it worth 6 bux to have this journal? or should I continue to use the News feature, like I am currently doing. I'll have to think about it more and decide by the time I get the gallery just the way I want it.
