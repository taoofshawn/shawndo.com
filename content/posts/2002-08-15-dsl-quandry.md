Finally scheduled to get internet in friday. Only took a month and a half of waiting. They are givin me a free installation. The quandry is the 6-month contract. My apartment complex just passed the word they might go with a local cable carrier because alot of the residents are not happy with the monopoly deal they gave us. So if that happens, I can have cable modem again, which I know is better than dsl. We'll see.  
  
Another instance of being in the right place, right time happened to me. I joined this hosting company called Eryxma a while ago. about 20 bucks a year. So now, they are installing some partitioning software so I can have complete control over my "host" Re-install the OS, handle the daemons, whatever. I'm totally psyked about it.
