Working all by my lonesome this week. My coworker is on vacation, so I have 3 long 12 hour shifts all by myself. One of the few times I've done this, I almost joined the Air Force. Right now, I'm kind of on a Navy kick, so I hope I won't end up joining the Navy. I have a book and a few things to do, so maybe I can keep my mind straight. Still debating about going to Times Square next week. It'd be an experience, but I don't think I'll enjoy it. Not very shawndo. The friend I was going with called me today, and sounded like he didn't care one way or the other. So I'm still debating.  
  
I finished reading the Bourne trilogy from Ludlum. I can't beleive it took me so long, but it really sucked! Maybe Clancy is a tough act to follow, but damn! I can't believe this series was successfull! I don't consider myself an expert on CIA or Special Operation or anything but there were times through that series that even I was yelling "BULLSHIT!" (Not unlike Tom Clancy's commentary on the Sum of all Fears DVD) If it's that easy, I'm gonna give it a shot. I'm gonna put some effort where my mouth is. Watch for a novel from Shawndo!
