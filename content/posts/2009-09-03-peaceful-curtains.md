Today was the first day I slept with the air conditioned turned off since summer started.  I'm not sure where this memory was from, but something deep in there just gives me a happy peaceful feeling when I see and hear a white curtain do that thing in front of an open window.  The being-blown-away-then-sucked-in-towards-the-window thing.  Love it!
