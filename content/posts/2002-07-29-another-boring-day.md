So I woke up today, watched some TV, then came to work. Another boring day. What I hate even more, is that I like boring. I _accidentally_ watched that show Blind Date, and everyone tries to be "exciting, adventurous, etc" That is almost the exact opposite of me. The only thing I can talk about is that I have been lucky enough to do some interesting travelling. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do this year. Not coming up with any ideas that I really want to do. AND!!!! I still don't have Internet in my new place. I have become so reliant on it. Even my ReplayTV thing needs the internet. and for TV watching, I got so used to the ReplayTV, I can't even watch TV anymore!. I am missing everything. Woe is me! ....Send pity email now....
