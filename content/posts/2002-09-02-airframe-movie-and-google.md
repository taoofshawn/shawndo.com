A while back, I had a journal entry mentioning that Crichton was coming out with 2 movies, but Airframe wasn't coming out. This fellow from New Zealand was kind enough to email me this [link][1]. I find this interesting, because if someone does a search on Google for "timeline movie" my site is around number 8 or 9 on the list. apparently that is how this guy found me. That Google is crazy!
