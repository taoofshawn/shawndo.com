It looks like the new company picks up the tab on any education that is work related. They will also pay for a complete degree program as long as the degree is work related. Alot of people are jumping on the band wagon but they are just going for individual certifications and such. Should I go for a degree? I work friday-sunday, so I certainly have enough time. I guess its all a question if I want a "routine" in my life. Time to grow up? I think I'll drive up to Lowell next week and talk to a UMASS advisor.
