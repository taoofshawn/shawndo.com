I've been doing this restore for about a week now, but my DLT drive keeps on dropping the leader. It took me a while to figure out how to fix that, and a couple of restore attempts to figure out I can restart the restores fairly reliably (without starting from the beginning again). So this time I should finish (maybe sometime tomorrow). I also just received my Alienware computer, but haven't set it up yet. I wanna set up my Dell for my sister first. Still waiting for my Titanium zippo I ordered on ebay. All in all, a fairly productive week. At work, they told me about a tape library I can take home, but they don't have any drives yet. Still waiting for those.  
  
Some family I've never met came up to New England to do some tourism stuff, and visit me at the same time. Good people! They live in Houston (where my sister is) I should have been visiting family more often back then, they really are pleasant folks.
