Working the first week after that long vacation. My coworker is on vacation this week, so I've been by myself all weekend! Been playing poker at partypoker a little bit. Doing OK and I've been too lazy to keep track of the stuff on "Poker History" any more. Have to decide if I want to keep that defunct page. Hmm, defunct is a cool word, maybe I'll put there somewhere on there. (Just about done with a 12 hour graveyard shift, so forgive the rambling)  

Movies:
- Phone Booth - sucked  
- Bruce Almighty - pretty good  
- Hulk - OK, better than I expected, love that Jennifer!  
- Confidence - Pretty good  
- Finding Nemo - BRRRR (Very good_  
- Italian Job - Pretty good. Love Charlize.  
- Matrix - eh, part 1 was better  
- T3 - Better than T2, but thats not saying much. Liked it though
