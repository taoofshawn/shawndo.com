I found out about 2 Michael Crichton movies coming out. One is old news, which is Timeline. I read the book, and it was pretty good, so I expect the movie to be pretty good, if they put enough money into it. I hear period pieces are expensive to do right. I like the book Airframe better, wish they would have made a movie on that one. Anwyay, a book called "Prey" is coming out in November, and Paramount already bought the movie rights for it. Don't know anything about it, but I haven't read a Crichton book I didn't like.
