My poor poor purple 486 finally died. This was my very first computer. its whopping 800 meg drive finally died. I suppose I could replace the drive, but it'll be a headache finding a hard drive that the bios could actually interpret. Since I wanted to get a 1U machine to replace this anyway, I saw a decent deal on a 1U Ibm Netfinity dual p3 on ebay. Did the "Buy now" option, and its on its way!  
  
We had some training at work this week on our Corporations "Vision and Strategy" so I am throughly indoctrinated now. Gonna go to NJ next week finally. I haven't one in a long time. I just get lazy and things seem to pop up. Set up a budget believe it or not. Its just a loose "recommendation" Although it will be rather forcefull. I'm going to have all this automatic investments happening, so I can only spend what I have left in my bank. Hopefully I allocated enough for "Food and Entertainment" We'll see how that works out...
