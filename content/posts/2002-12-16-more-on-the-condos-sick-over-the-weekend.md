I got a call back from the guy selling those 500K condos. Apparently they are only for people aged 55 and up. So even if I could afford it, I couldn't get one. That's still crazy.  
  
Just got sick over the weekend. Haven't gotten sick in a long time. Last time I can remember getting sick was 1997. After first moving to Austin, the change of the climate or something hit me. But moving here didn't do a thing.  
  
I saw a couple great movies. I've been watching IFC and Sundance lately. [Legend of 1900][1] and [Shadow Magic.][2] Watch 'em! "If you do have the means, I highly recommend you pick one up" What movie?
