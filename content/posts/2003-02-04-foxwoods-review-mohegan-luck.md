Went to foxwoods. Walked around alot, and saw that it was way to crowded. Strange, even though it's bigger than Mohegan Sun, it felt crowded. Apparently it's more popular, and more people go there in general. The layout was more spread out and had smaller pit areas. Just an overall crowded feeling. We didn't even bother staying. Drove down to Mohegan Sun again. Changed 500, hit the Baccarat tables, and after a few hours cashed out 1007 dollars!. So total I'm up 600 bucks from my 2 trips! I gotta quit while I'm ahead. At least stop playing Baccarat. Next time I go, I'm all poker.
