My little baby sister got married!

I was in Brownsville for 10 days to attend my sister Shannon's wedding. I have a few pictures in my photo album under "History" She is so cute and looks really happy. I'm so jealous :( I had a good time in Brownsville visiting my friends and eating mexican food. We did Soprano watching marathons all week, between making taco runs to Mexico and some mexican places in Brownsville. I remember thinking how much I hated Brownsville, but compared to this area, it's a freakin paradise. I'd take extremely hot weather over this extreme cold weather any day. It was awesome wearing shorts while I was down there.  

Next week, I'll be in San Diego for some work-related training. I remember liking San Diego alot, I'm looking forward to it.
