Checking out this article thing, which I plan to use as a journal. Seems to work OK.

So I happened to have a patch panel laying around, and the new place is wired for cat5, but have all the cables hanging loose in the utility closet. This just irks me that no one punched this stuff down! Why would you even install cat5 if you didnt punch it down! The telephone cable is punched right next to the loose cat5. Oh well.....borrowing a punch tool from work, and gonna do it myself. Coincidentally, im setting up my Sun rack right next to the closet, so it'll work out good. I'll get pictures up soon.
