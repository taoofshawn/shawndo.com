Messing around with the whole syndication thing. I just heard of RSS newsfeeds for the first time. I finally understand what this backend.php does. I put a Shawndo block on [The-Drews.com][1] Now I'm just trying to get the image correctly, which is part of the reason I'm adding this entry :) Just want to make sure I didn't screw up my backend.php file so much that it stops updating. We'll see!  
  
By the way, for future reference, [syndic8.com][2] is a good resource for finding newsfeeds.
