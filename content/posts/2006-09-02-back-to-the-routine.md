Things have calmed down and it's time to look for another job. I've been going to the gym every day, so I'll at least have something to feel good about, even if it takes a while to find a job. I've also started playing the guitar a little bit more. I compiled a list of all the songs I used to play in high school, and seeing how much I still remember. It's surprising how much is still stored in my head. I don't remember the words, but my fingers seem to remember how to play a lot of these songs. My goal is to learn about 10 songs all the way through. Songs that sound ok with a solo guitar and easy to play. Like maybe a little GNR Patience, Poison - Every Rose, songs like that. There is one song that I always wanted to learn in high school, and I've discovered that it is pretty easy. Unfortunately, no one up here will know what the hell I'm singing, since it's in Spanish. It's a song from Mana called "Vivir Sin Aire". If you were a high school girl growing up near the border 10 years ago, and a guy played that song for you.... Anyway, it's a song I've always wanted to learn, and that's the immediate guitar goal.

So tonight, on my way to a restaurant, I was standing too close to a corner with a large puddle in front of it. A cab came speeding by and i got caught in the surfing-quality wave that resulted. I was facing the other way, and the back of my pants looked like I sat in a puddle. The coverage was quite spectacular. And yes, there was an audience, but they didn't laugh, thankfully. It was like something from a movie. It happened in slow motion. I didn't see the wave, but as soon as I heard the splash, I saw the faces of my audience slowly fall in sympathy. I just stood there for 10 seconds nodding my head with a "of-course" look on my face. Made some funny comments to the audience, then headed back home. I told Humby and then finally got the laugh that it deserved! We took a picture to preserve this for all history! The water in the puddle wasn't exactly Fiji, so I took another shower and headed out again. I did get nervous as I approached the corner, but it was a one-time incident. Hopefully it won't happen again...
