I've been purposely not writing for a while.  Mainly because of things actually moving on the job front, and not wanting to speak too soon.  I still won't, but there it is..  

In other news, I've heard of this hippie detox fasting thing, that also has a side effect of weight loss.  As I read more about it, I realized it was the same thing Ed told me about last year.  That should say it all!! Anyway, it's called the [Master Cleanser][1] and involves just drinking this lemonade concoction for a minimum of 10 days.  Then you need to ease yourself into eating solid food again.  It sounded like something I could actually do, so I'm giving it a try.  I'm on day two now, and haven't had any issues.  Whenever I get hungry, I just have a few of those lemonade drinks, and I forget all about food.  

Skeptics say that you just gain all the weight back afterwards, it's all about lifestyle change, etc, etc.  It probably will come back, I tend towards skepticism myself.  But I have already changed my lifestyle.  I'm already losing weight at a slow rate.  I'm not going back to the way I was living in Austin and MA.  So who knows.  I'm hoping this will be like a little boost to my current lifestyle.  I think the chance is worth the effort in this case.  

To keep myself occupied over the last couple days, I borrowed Adam's camera and took a ton of [photos of my watches][2].  Created a new sub-album that has one album for each watch.  I know... sick. I was messing with the exposure, manual focus and all that, and I think I got some really cool photos now.
