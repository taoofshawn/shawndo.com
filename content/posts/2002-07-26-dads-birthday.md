So its my dad's birthday. They got a DVD player recently so I sent him Spy Game and Sneakers. Two great spy-type movies.  
  
I saw K-19. It was a good movie, but it was no Red October. Red October set the bar so high for sub movies. K-19 was very believable, but I don't know that I like a sub movie without any torpedos. Maybe it's just because this was based on a real incident. And I'm not too keen on the whole stone-cold Communist Party member captain tearing up when people die from radiation. Oh well, it is a sub movie, so I'll probably buy it anyway when it comes out on DVD.
