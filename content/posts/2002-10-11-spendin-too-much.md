I just realized I was spending too much this past month. I have however done some responsible things, like join the ESPP for my company. Got a couple credit cards to work on my credit. (I'm 26 and these are my first credit cards) What I need to work on is:  
  
- figuring out the IRA thing, like if 401K contribution affects how much you can put into an IRA  
  
- Find an accountant  
  
- Set aside the whole 3-6 months of living money  
  
- Somewhere in that chronology, I need to set up a budget. I want to wait until I see the effect of this ESPP before I iron it out.  
  
Stuff I bought in the last 2 months:  
  
- Dual Xeon 2.4 gHz Alienware  
  
- Couch and coffee table  
  
- Trip to Brownsville, TX  
  
- Washer and Dryer for my mom  
  
- pair of 120 gB IBM drives  
  
- Sopranos seasons 1-3 for myself, then bought a copy for Humby (bday)  
  
- Bunch of DVDs and stuff from Amazon

So am I spending too much?
