I drove by some newly built condos for sale on my way home from work (which means they are actually closer to work that my current 7 miles) They looked pretty nice, I thought they would be a little expensive but still in my price range. It's possible they didn't put the listings up yet (I hope) because I did a search for the agent, and found some of his listings. They were all 500K and up! I am hoping these aren't the same condos. I'm calling to find out for sure, but damn. Freakin MA!  
  
In other news, my D1000 actually works! I got all the parts I needed, and put it all together. works great! Totally worth the 200 bucks or so that I paid for it.
