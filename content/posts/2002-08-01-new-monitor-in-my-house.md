Got my brand spankin new [LCD][1] This is a really nice screen. My first monitor breaking the 20" barrier. It has a 20.1" viewable screen, so I guess thats equivalant to a 21" CRT. I never realized how much the display adds to a computer.  
  
So My sister took off to Belize and apparently her apartments dont take deliveries or something. The computer I bought for her went through 3 delivery attempts! Now I gotta keep on top of UPS to make sure they don't return it.
