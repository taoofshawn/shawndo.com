I haven't written anything in a while. Basically nothing has been going on. I've just been dealing with my braces. Developing better dental habits and all that. Apparently I wasn't brushing correctly. I'm freakin 27 years old and I didn't know how to brush my teeth. (Aiming it in the right direction to deal with your gums and all that) So now my gums are doing alot better. Other than dental matters, I broke down and bought an Ipod, 'cause all my friends got one. 

I set it up unobtrusively in my car and it's doing good. I am notoriously lazy with burning cd's to use in my car, and this keeps me from listening to the same 3 or 4 cds for 2+ years at a time (like I have been doing) I put my whole 20+ gig mp3 collection on there, and its doing good so far. I need to listen to it a while and decide what music I actually like. For now I have a bunch of comedy albums on there for the long trips, a bunch of jazz and classical albums as well as some of the normal pop stuff. the ID3 tags are pretty importand to Ipod, so it took a while for me to set that all up. Not as bad as I was expecting because I found some decent software to help out.
