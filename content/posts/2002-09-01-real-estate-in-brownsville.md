I'm going to make the jump into being a homeowner. Just not my own. My parents suggested I buy some property in Brownsville, TX. The found some properties near the hospital over there for a decent deal. Also, there are a bunch of filipinos over there now for the new hospital. Seems like all the people they know in real estate don't have a problem finding renters in Brownsville. Even if there is a renter problem, the mortgage for a property in Brownsville would just be spending money for the cost of living up here. Since its all invested, I can't find a negative Everything I read doesn't really say anything negative about real estate as an investment/business. So.. Im jumpin in head first, see what happens. My father is doing this through a limited liability corporation that we will create, so it shouldn't be dangerous for me financially.
