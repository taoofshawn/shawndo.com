I recently got an IMAP email account, I have always heard about IMAP having problems, and for some reason POP3 is more popular. Now that I have seen IMAP, I can't see why anyone would not use this!?! You have your messages on the server, access it from anywhere with any email client. Mutt has IMAP access. Squirrelmail is a Free (note capital "F") web-based IMAP client. What else is there to talk about ?
