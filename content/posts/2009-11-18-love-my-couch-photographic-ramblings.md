I just wanted to take a photo of the couch and ottoman.  I've had them almost a year now and I think it just gets softer and better looking as time goes by.  Nothing like awesome leather.  I'm also still trying to learn a little lighting (possibly the real reason I took the photo!) Ramblings:  That highlight in the cushion is still stumping me.  I know I read about how to do this right, but I can't remember!  [Light, Science and Magic][1]..  I'm fairly sure I need to "flag" the light from hitting that part of the cushion, but it seems that I'm blocking the whole light when I try do it.  Back to the book.  Maybe there is some polarizing to be done...
