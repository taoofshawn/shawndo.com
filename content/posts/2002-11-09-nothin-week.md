I didn't so anythnig this week. I love it! I didn't even go out to go ffod shopping. I just ate ramen and granola bars all week. Sometimes I wish I didn't like not donig anything, but whatever, I'm happy.  
  
I broke down and bought the Samsung a500 phone. It's awesome, except for the fact its a SprintPCS phone, but I can deal with it. The phone IS that cool.  
  
I finished part one in the Bourne series, Bourne Identity. The one they made a movie about. There were some vague similarities, but they changed the whole plot and took out the bad guy! But it was different enough to appreciate both as their own stories.
