A few hours ago, I put on my brand new sneakers and got prepared to do some exercise.  
  
Plan:  
  
- Stretch for 10 mintes.  
- Run over to the exercise room,  
- get on a stationary bike and ride that deal while the Oreilly Factor was on TV. (The got TVs over there)  
- Job back to cool down  
- Stretch for another 10 minutes.  
  
Execution:  
  
- Stretched for 10 minutes, check
- Ran over to the exercise room. OK, two BIG problems here:  
  1. I am so out of shape that the minor job to the exercise room had me lightheaded, almost to the point of hallucinating. I lost my peripheral vision, and thought seriously about fainting.  
  2. (Thankfully) my key didn't work for the exercise room.  
- I recovered after a few minutes, then forced myself to run back then up my stairs.  
- Got in then stretched for like 3 mintutes and just about collapsed. 

I can't believe I'm THIS much out of shape! (well, maybe I can) Oh well, I will keep at it for a while. Where is all the "Exercise makes me feel good" crap? The feeling was almost similar to some heavy inebriation (which I'm not a fan of either.) If that's what you exercise nuts are talkin about, y'all are a bunch of idiots! I hope you aren't the same people that say being drunk and high is cool!
