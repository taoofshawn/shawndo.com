I don't typically report news items, I think that's a little too overdone, but here is a [great story][1] that I couldn't pass up. So beleive it or not, I turned down a 6-figure government contract to do TSM for the U.S. Navy in Norfolk, VA. I just want a little stability right now, and I didn't want to front the 10K of expenses it would take to get me down there as quick as they wanted me to go. Oh well, more opportunities will show up if/when I want them.
