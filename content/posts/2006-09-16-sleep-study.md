I took a cool picture, and I had to write the story to go with it.  
For as long as I can remember, I’ve had sinus issues. I’ve always accepted it as normal until I was discussing it with a friend of mine. He was describing several symptoms he had and his recent diagnosis from his doctor. It was starting to sound like I had a deviated septum and all the associated issues. He also told me that the fix was a fairly simple procedure with a very short recovery. I started dreaming about actually breathing properly.  

I finally set up an appointment with my doctor to get a diagnosis. I imagine the internet is an annoyance to doctors nowadays. I tried not to be too annoying, but I started using vocabulary I learned on wikipedia and the various health sites out there. Luckily he was dismissing everything I was saying and just looked at me. He looked in my ear, nose and throat. He said he saw some irritations and wasn’t convinced I had a deviated septum. He started listing a few different things it could be, but wanted to refer me to an Ear-Nose-Throat specialist. He also specializes in sleep disorders, which are related, and that is also one of my symptoms (possible apnea, snoring, etc)  

I head over to the specialist, and while I’m there, he sticks a camera in my nose! It goes all the way in and around to the area where your nasal cavity meets your throat. He has pictures on the wall showing what things _should_ look like. Everything was symmetrical in my septum, so it isn’t deviated. I had some other things that were swollen. On top of that, compared to the picture on the wall, everything looked all tight and claustrophobic in there! I thought it might be related to my overbite, but I stuck my jaw out as much as I could and it was still very restricted.  

The Doctor explained that this restricted airflow can manifest in several ways and started listing a bunch of symptoms, most of which I had. My main concern was breathing while I sleep, but I always wake up tired and feeling generally horrible. So he set me up for a sleep study.  

I went to the sleep study, and they hooked up all sorts of wires to me. It looked quite scary. Needless to say, I had problems falling asleep, but they got the data they needed. Now I’m waiting for the results from the Doctor, but I’m pretty sure I caught the apnea!
