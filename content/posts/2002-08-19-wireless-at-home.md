First update from home! and, I'm sitting in my bean bag chair in my living room on wireless, Watching my ReplayTV, chattin. Slept a good 10 hours today... Life is good. Now I just need my couch and coffee table to be delivered, then I'll be styling. Instead of using bean bag ottomans for my laptop, I'll actually have a table. Alright, enough talk, back to ReplayTV!
