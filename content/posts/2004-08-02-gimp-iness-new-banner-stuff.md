I've used [the GIMP][1] before (As you can see on my "Powered By" page) but I haven't updated it in a while, and never used it on Windows. I downloaded a copy of the latest 2.0 version for Windows to do some work on the Shawndo.com banner. (I wanted to add a couple with my car) It has really come a long way! 

It imported all the layers in from my original banner file. I figured out the layer masks, gradients, colourize, and all the other stuff I needed to make the new banners, in a matter of minutes. I also found a ton of tutorials and help on the internet. From what I understand, it has a way to go to be able to replace Photoshop completely, but it's way more than enough for me and anything I can imagine. < end plug now >
