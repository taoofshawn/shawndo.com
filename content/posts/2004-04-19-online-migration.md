If you are reading this, then the DNS updates have propagated... I did a quick change from my old hosting site, because they had some major drama going on. You can read more about it [here][1].  
I did a lot more research and hopefully chose wisely this time. I can tell the connection is a lot faster. Hopefully it will stay that way.  
When I setup all this stuff last time, I remember it taking a really long time, and for some reason I didn't make a shawndo-howto. It was frustrating figuring everything out all over again. Especially when I would get stuck at some point, and knowing that I had figured it out at one point.  
Oh well, I setup the daemontools,dns,mail, (The whole [DJB][2] situation!) web, imap services with ssl and all that good stuff finally. 

You should read a little about this [DJB][2] guy as well as try his software. For some reason it just feels artistic to me, in some odd, weirdo, geeky way. Simple, focused, effective, and powerful. 

So anyway, when I see this entry on here, then I'll know the move has completed.
