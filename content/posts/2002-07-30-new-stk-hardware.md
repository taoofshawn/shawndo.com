I came into work today for my internet fix (still don't have dsl) and we got a new laptop and badge for the new company (StorageTek). Laptops aren't IBM's, they are Dell's, but they are still pretty good. 1.2 ghz and 512 megs of RAM and a DVD drive. a step up from the last laptop, but they have Big Brother MS SMS on there. I gotta ask around and see what the policy is on changing all that. So STK makes a mid-high end tape libraries and related storage hardware. Why did people in the orientation look at me funny when I asked if we got employee discounts on STK branded hardware? Wouldn't everyone want a rackmounted dual drive DLT library? Am I the only one with a 7 cartridge DLT Autochanger at home?
