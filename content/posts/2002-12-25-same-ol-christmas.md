Its Christmas today, but otherwise is the same 'ol stuff going on. Sleeping weird hours. Watching TV and reading. Only not all the shows are on because of Christmas! My mom asked me what I wanted, and I just said maybe some cologne and some mittens. Then she told me to send her links to show her exactly what I wanted! On top of that, they "scolded" my sister for not knowing exactly what she wanted from them, and having the links ready. Is it just me that thinks there is something a little strange about this? I didn't get anyone anything. I got presents for everyone throughout the year. I think this is better because there is no deadline, and you can get something genuine. As opposed to meeting the shopping deadline. For my father, I am building that website though, and that was at the end of the year, but that happened to be the timing.
