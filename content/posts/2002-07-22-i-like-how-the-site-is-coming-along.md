So I uploaded a bunch of pictures, and like how everything is coming out. Still looking for a journal module for .714 contact me if you know of one. 

Also got a camera finally. took a few boring pictures and uploaded them. It is a damn good camera. [Check it out][1]. I think this is too much camera for me, since I am dumbing it down and only taking 1024x768 photos, but I like the presets it has. Apparently you can adjust fstops, ISO levels, focal lengths, and all that. The presets dumb it down for me and translate those settings to "portrait, landscape, low light, etc" Since I'm not into photography, I appreciate dumbing down :)
