My sister got engaged 2 weeks ago! I knew back then, I just forogt to write something about it. She is getting married to the "boy" after dating for a pretty long time. I think they are looking at early next year for the date. I guess I have to start calling him "Ryan" instead of "the boy" now. I met him a few times, seems like a good guy. My sister is also a responsible type, so she'll be ok. Only thin I am worried about.. I can NOT imagine her with a child. Not pregnant or anything, you just always think about children when you hear "marriage". I don't think I can be a proper uncle anyway, living this far away! I was also a little jealous of my friends when they had family around. I'd have to look into moving around there if I hear "news" Not that I need an excuse to leave MA and go back to Texas.
