Well, after some testing, i found that this article thing has an expiration. Not really good for a journal. I found another journal, but apparently it has problems with the .714 version of Postnuke, cause its module API was rewritten. oh well, i guess I'll just wait.

In the mean time, I spent all day yesterday trying to figure out how to get a photo gallery to work on a shared virtual host. Apparently people on my host went through my exact issues, and answers are in their forums. I recommend my hosting company [Eryxma][1]. From reading [this][2] forum entry, you can see they go above and beyond to help out (Shiekron is the eryxma employee)
