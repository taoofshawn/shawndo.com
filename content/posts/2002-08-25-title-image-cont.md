Finally figured out the title image thing with the help of my 14 year old cousin! After staring at his answer for a while, I figured what I did wrong. I was basically right the first time I tried, but i was missing one reference, and that caused me to butcher what I was doing and made it worse! Oh well, it's working now. So now I'm going to make a bunch of different title images, then try to get it to randomly select one when someone visits.
